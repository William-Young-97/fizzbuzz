# Fizzbuzz test

This simple program will print "fizz" on multiples of 3 and "buzz" on multiples of 5. On multiples of 5 and 3 it will print "fizzbuzz". The main purpose of this program was to practice test driven development (TDD), using Rspec. 

## Objectives

- Get comfortable with using Rspec to write tests and then write code.
- Learn to hardcode Rspec tests.
- Use the following process: Feature test, unit test, code implementation, unit test, feature test and refactor.

## Technologies used

- Ruby
- Rspec

## Conclusion

Fizzbuzz is a fantastic program to begin learning TDD with. It stays simple, whilst introducing key TDD process and Rspec syntax.
